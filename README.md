# dice
A Dice Game - built from Scrimba - Front End Web Development Course.

Once the player reaches a score of 20, the game stops and announces a winner.

Created a game using JavaScript with a little bit of HTML and CSS

The main goal here was to manipulate the DOM and grab elements from the HTML.

The roll button was created by using the Math.floor and Math.random while adding a + 1 to ensure the dice rolls from 1-6. 

Added an event listener for when the button is clicked, elements change on the page.

Added and Removed an 'active' element for when each player has a turn to roll the dice, using the classList method. 

Once a player reaches a score of 20, the Roll Dice button is hidden by using the display: 'none' property and a reset button appears.

The reset button resets all the elements on the page back to the default starting point.
